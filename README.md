# The Prompt Bazaar

Prompt Bazaar is a web application that I developed using the Next.js framework of React. Its main purpose is to create a platform for users to share and discover prompts. The app allows users to log in using Google authentication, ensuring a secure and easy login process.

Once logged in, users can create, read, update, and delete prompt posts. These prompt posts are essentially short writing prompts or ideas that users can share with the community. Other users can view these prompts and get inspired by the creative ideas shared by fellow users.

The app features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the prompts. One of the key functionalities is the ability to view prompts posted by all users and explore the creativity and diversity of ideas in the community.

Additionally, Prompt Bazaar allows users to view profiles of other users, enabling them to connect and engage with like-minded individuals. It fosters a collaborative and supportive environment for writers and creative thinkers to exchange thoughts and inspire each other.
